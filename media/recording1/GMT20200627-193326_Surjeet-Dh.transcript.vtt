Surjeet Dhillon: Alright guys, it's very funny situation that you have to be in yourself, talking to yourself in the meeting where you're doing a meeting with yourself and trying to be very happy right now because I have to generate some

2
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.289
Surjeet Dhillon: face recognition stuff 

3
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.470
Surjeet Dhillon: and it has to be very happy and the agenda of this meeting all switch back to down is that to streamline the next steps on the post go live activities.

4
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:44.640
Surjeet Dhillon: That was very, very strange that the client for us, you know, not really, with the next, you know, the last certificates and we had to push yesterday.

5
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.340
Surjeet Dhillon: But overall I think we have we had figured out the, the overall go live activities and then we were able to successfully push to production.

6
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:10.980
Surjeet Dhillon: Which brings to our firstly, the next release, which is could you for 10th of July, and we need to see if we have enough dev resources to work on the pending tickets and

7
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:30.300
Surjeet Dhillon: Also, I was thinking that we need to think from the perspective of the new deployment process that if we can build on demo environment. First, so that we can avoid any kind of regressions. I don't like the regressions, I have to say, like this expression because I'm testing it.

8
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.790
Surjeet Dhillon: And then so checking these I believe our next step should be to be, you know, if we can talk to Gabby and we can say that we need some additional front end depth.

9
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.590
Surjeet Dhillon: And then also the next step will be that I will check with client if they have logged all the tickets

12
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.450
Surjeet Dhillon: And see if the Jenkins is set up perfectly fine for that. Okay, I'll stop laughing now.

13
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.640
